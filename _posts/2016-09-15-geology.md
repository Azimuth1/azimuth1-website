Core samples provide sedimentary composition information for remediation sites and can be useful when planning a site's sampling program.

The presence of geologic core information in SmartData Solutions streamlines the site characterization process for both engineers and regulators.  Users are able to compare contaminant concentrations, hydraulic conductivity values, and geology of the site easily in one interface.
